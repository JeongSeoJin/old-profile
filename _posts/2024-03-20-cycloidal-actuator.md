## 1. Abstract
The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a **Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD) actuator** tailored for dynamic legged robots. Unlike traditional high-ratio gearboxes, QDD actuators prioritize **back-drivability** and **torque transparency**.

I developed a custom **15:1 cycloidal reducer** integrated with a high-torque BLDC motor. The system utilizes **Field Oriented Control (FOC)** via a Moteus controller to achieve precise torque control. This report details the design methodology, manufacturing process using 3D printing (PA-CF12) and CNC machining, and the validation of the system.
