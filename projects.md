### 1. [Cycloidal QDD Actuator](/quasi-direct-drive-actuator/)
**2025.7.5 - Present**

> **"Designed a low-cost, high-torque actuator for dynamic legged robots."**

I designed and built a high-torque actuator using a custom cycloidal gear and BLDC motor. This project focuses on back-drivability and precise torque control.

* **Key Tech:** BLDC Motor, Cycloidal Gear, FOC Control, CNC
* **Status:** Testing & Validation
