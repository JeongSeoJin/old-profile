### [Cycloidal QDD Actuator](/project-c-qdd-actuator/c-qdd-actuator.md)
**2025.7.5 - Present**

> **"Designed a Cycloidal QDD Actuator for dynamic robots."**

I designed and built a cycloidal quasi-direct drive actuator using a custom cycloidal gear and BLDC motor. This project focuses on back-drivability, high responsiveness and precise torque control.

* **Keywards:** BLDC Motor, Cycloidal Gear, QDD architecture, 3D printing, robotic actuator
* **Status:** Testing & Validation
